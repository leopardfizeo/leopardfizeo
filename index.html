<p></p> Plastic is a useful tool but, have you ever thought about how much damage plastic can do to the environment.<p></p>
<p>A plastic is a kind of material that is made by people and can be made into almost any shape. Most plastics are strong, long-lasting, and lightweight. They resist damage by water, heat, chemicals, and electricity. In addition, plastics can be made in lots of different colors.</p>
<p>There are about 50 main types of plastic. They have countless uses. people often use plastics in place of more expensive materials. In nylon stockings, for example, plastic takes the place of silk. In vinyl house siding, plastic takes the place of wood. In many automobile body parts, plastic takes the place of metal.</p>
<p>Plastic is very bad especially for the ocean and some people just dump plastic right on top of some of those poor sea animals and those animals who arenâ€™t dying from eating plastic are dying from the large quantities of fish that are being brought in by fishermen.</p>
<p>Now enough about the ocean right now I am going to ask you a question, What would you rather have a plastic bag that you can only use once or a recycleable plastic bag that is good for the enviroment. I would chose the fabric bag.</p>
<p>Where do you put your plastic when it is useless? Most people put it in the bin. most of the time you have to that is why people made recycleable plastic, so that you can use it again and again and again until it starts to disintergrate (which is in 500 years) so if you buy plastic at the super market make sure you only by it if you have to.</p>
<p> So now would you think twice before you by plastic at the super market (or anywhere) cause i think that the fabric is way better than any plastic anytime and if you see rubbish on the road or anywhere especalliy in the ocean pick it up and put eather in the rubbishbin or in your pocket.</p>
